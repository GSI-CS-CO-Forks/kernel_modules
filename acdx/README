README Help about the AC-Dipole driver, library, test program and installation.

The ACDX software needs a directory on the host DSC in the local path as follows...

/usr/local/drivers/acdx

An exact copy of this directory is kept here in the acdx directory.

A rather unusual install is acomplished by simply copying this local directory
to the final target location using these commands ...

sudo cp -R acdx /acc/dsc/oplhc/L865/2.6.24.7-rt21
sudo cp -R acdx /acc/dsc/lab/L865/2.6.24.7-rt21

After rebuilding the driver the object file should be copied to the local acdx directory prior
to issuing the copy command ...

cp /dsrc/drivers/coht/acdx/object_acdx/acdx.2.6.24.7-rt21.ko /dsrc/drivers/coht/acdx/acdx

The FPGA image that is used by the loader is pointed to by the link Acdx.bit in the test directory,
at the time of writing the link looks like this ...

Acdx.bit -> x3_servo_v2.10.bit

The places where the software and libraries look for files is controlled through the file ...

acdxtest.config

The actual file is kept in the test directory, but a link to this file is needed in acdx ...

acdxtest.config -> test/acdxtest.config

This is because the built in path name for the front end software is ...

/usr/local/drivers/acdx/acdxtest.config

After compiling the test program acdxtest copy /dsrc/drivers/coht/acdx/test/acdxtest.L865 to
this place ...

/dsrc/drivers/coht/acdx/acdx/test/acdxtest

this results in the test program path /usr/local/drivers/acdx/test/acdxtest on the target system.
A symbolic link has been set up in /usr/local/bin so that the testprogram can be launched with
the simple command acdxtest

Driver installation and hardware setup on the front end is acomplished by running the local scripts
in /usr/local/driver/acdx/install via the scripts install.native and setup.acdx.
A symbolic link in the install directory is used to load the driver for the correct kernel ...

acdx.2.6.24.7-rt21.ko -> ../acdx.2.6.24.7-rt21.ko

If we change kernel the install.native script looks for "acdx.`uname -r`.ko" so you would need to
change the above link. I did not use an anonymus link delibratley to ensure the kernel change does
not attempt to load the driver for the wrong kernel version.
Once the driver has been installed correctly the setup.acdx shell script is run. This script calls
on acdxtest to load the FPGA firmware and to initialize the PLL parameters on the x3servo module.
These commands are driven from the transfer.ref file in the usual way as follows ...

#
# Install, load VHDL and configure X3-SERVO driver for AC Dipole
#% cd /usr/local/drivers/acdx/install; ./install.native; ./setup.acdx

The final settings are applied from the acdx library (libacdx.a) when the FESA class starts.
Here the sinwave is generated and loaded, and the ADC and DAC enabled.
A call to AcdxArm is made from FESA and the system then waits for a trigger comming from the
CTR to generate the function.

A shell script is available to do the acquisitions of the 6
currents and voltages for postmortem purposes...

/usr/local/drivers/acdx/aqn.acdx

This script keeps two copies current and previous (old) in the /tmp directory...

-rw-rw-r-- 1 root  root  1637706 Jun  5 11:56 /tmp/AcdxAqn.rov.old

the script is best run with root privaleges.
