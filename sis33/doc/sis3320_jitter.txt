SIS3320 Stop trigger correction bits

There were a problem appeared in June, 14 2011. After some dozens of acquisitions and
plotting the sampled data in the same graph, the clients realized that there was
a jitter in the sampled signal.

The source of this jitter was unexplained: the signal was OK in the oscilloscope and the
SIS3300 behaved properly. After a quick question to Struck Innovative Systeme, they
answered with the following email.

Hello Samuel,

did you or your client use the "rearrange with regard to the trigger correction bits" ?
I try to explain:

The sampled data are stored always in group four samples in the SIS3302/SIS3320 memory.
In Stop mode the STOP could come anywhere between single samples but the logic stops the sampling after a group of four samples.

Please, have a look to the illustration "sis3320-Z-050611-1-v100-wrap-rearrange-illustration1.pdf".
This illustration shows how the logic sammples the data in groups of four (yellow/red groups).
With a "Simple" rearrangement regardless of the Stop correction bits you will see what you see on your plots.

Please, have now a look to the illustration "sis3320-Z-050611-1-v100-wrap-rearrange-illustration2.pdf". 
This shows a rearrangement with regard to the Stop correction bits.

The intention to use the rearrangement with regard to the Stop correction bits is that the samples, where the trigger (STOP1, STOP2 .. STOP4) occurs, on the same x-axsis value are displayed.

In this case you should remove two (one) samples from the beginning and two samples from the end of the page, to have a plot which you are expected.

Please, have a look to the manual chapter: ADC1-8 Next Sample address register (bits 1 and 0)

Best regards

Tino
