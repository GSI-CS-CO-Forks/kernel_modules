PLease use stuff from the 64bit directory even for 32bit platforms
The 32bit directory should probably be depricated, but I keep it because
there may still be issues that I am not currently aware of.

in the 32/64bit directories you will find

driver/             This is the CTR driver using <stdint.h> integer definitions
		    The driver can be compiled for L865 and L866
		    The driver include files are delivered to the libctr includes

test/               This is the raw ioctl call test program suite, it compiles on L865/6 ok
		    I have added SizeVme.L865/6 and SizePci.L865/6 for comparrison of structure sizes

timlib/libctr/      This is the new library used exclusivley by the timing section
		    Its NOT for public consumption

timlib/libctr/test/ This is the library test program

timlib/tim/         This is the old timing library that call Tgm and Tgv, its still in use
		    This version runs on L866 and L865 and is based on the new driver includes

timlib/tim/test     The timlib test program
		    The subdirectory TcpStuff contains all the CNGS (Grand Sasso) UDP sender
		    It also contains the event stream pusher JavTgmServer and other important stuff
		    The subdirectory DiagStuff contains the timing surveilance, I think this is no longer used

About the git repo, there is a git repo at the directory root, and another at libctr
