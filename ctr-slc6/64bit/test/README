For the standard CERN BE/CO test programs (Needs libraries to be installed)

make -f GNUmakefile.vme

For experiments and users who don't want a lot of CERN BE/CO libraries use the "nops" makefiles
Build the test program for the CTRP and CTRI PCI cards
make -f GNUmakefile.pci.nops

For experiments and users who don't want a lot of CERN BE/CO libraries use the "nops" makefiles

of the CTR_VME flag. Be very careful not to deliver the PCI version anywhere.
Also be carefull about delivering compilation options in the test program in the ppc4 environment.
