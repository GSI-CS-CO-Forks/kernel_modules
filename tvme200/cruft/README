To make either the PCI or the VME version

rm Makefile
ln -s Makefile.pci Makefile

or

rm Makefile
ln -s Makefile.vme Makefile

Then you just do the usual

make CPU=L865 Kver=2.6.29.4-rt15

or what ever version you want

===============

The Module.symvers file must be read/write
In order to define the symbols used in Sebastiens
VME-Bridge driver the file should be present.
A make clean deletes it, so for VME you need to
check it out read/write.
