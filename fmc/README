This is a container for all fmc-related developments. The point
of the package is collecting a known-good set of versions for
all the submodules.

Unfortunately, each package includes submodules on its own; for
example most include fmc-bus. This choice is meant to help our
external users, who often run a single FMC device within a SPEC
carrier.  The code, however, is designed to pick headers from
../fmc-bus (and so on) if both it and fmc-bus are submodules of
something else.

By default, running "make" builds all packages, but you can use

   make CONFIG_SVEC=n

if you want to skip svec-sw (I do it, for example, because svec-sw
depends on header files and pathnames I miss).  Same applies for
other packages, please check the toplevel Makefile for exact names.
