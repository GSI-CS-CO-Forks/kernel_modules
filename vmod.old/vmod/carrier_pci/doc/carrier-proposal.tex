\section{Introduction}

At this moment, two carrier boards need to be supported by BE/CO/HT,
to wit:
\begin{compactdesc}
\item[VMOD-IO] A VME carrier board supporting up to 4 mezzanine modules
\item[MOD-PCI] A PCI carrier board supporting up to 2 mezzanine modules
\end{compactdesc}

The purpose of this document is to summarize the experience acquired
on the support of these cards during the development of drivers for a
number of mezzanines (VMOD-12A2, VMOD-16A2, VMOD-12E16 and VMOD-TTL),
and to make a proposal for the design of a proper carrier module driver.
The proposal intends to establish a very basic API for the driver that
allows drivers for the mezzanine modules to query for their address
spaces and interrupt configuration, so that the carrier is just an
intermediary that gets out of the way of the more specialized mezzanine
drivers as soon as possible.

\section{Developments made so far}

For a quick support of the VMOD familiy of mezzanines demanded by one of
our clients, the first design took the shape described in
figure~\ref{kludge1.0}
