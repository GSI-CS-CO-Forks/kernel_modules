This is a kosher linux version of the CTR without all the LynxOs emulation crap

In each directory driver and libctr there is a test directory with the test program

I have fully tested this driver and I trust it more than what is currently installed.
There are a few minor API changes to some more exotic routines, but they do not break existing code.
None the less I recomend to deliver from here the driver, libraries and test program.
Some changes do affect some ioctls used by the test programs such as read event history.
