This is a kosher linux version of the CTR without all the LynxOs emulation crap

In each directory driver and libctr there is a test directory with the test program

I have fully tested this driver and I trust it more than what is currently installed.
There are a few minor API changes so a relink is needed if TimLib is being used.
