Here are some test utilities that access the hardware accross TimLib.
In theory the TimLib library is to be depricated, however I suspect this library will out live libctr that is supposed to replace it.
TimLib is not a hardware test library, so timtest is a simple tool to help users to debug their code.
If you need to debug the hardware then use ctrtest.

In this directory is a sub directory TcpStuff. This contains the TimClient and TimServer programs that are used to send event
streams accross UDP sockets to Java clients running in work stations, these programs are vital.

A subdirectory of TcpStuff is CNGS. In this directory the SendCNGS and RecvCNGS programs are used to synchronize pre-triggers
in the equipment located in the Grans Sasso cave in Italy. When a CNGS cycle is about to be executed the UDP packet arriving on
multiple computers in Grand Sasso arm their detectors. This is needed to suppress false neutrino events and to protect equipment
by removing the need to apply very high voltages when no neutrinos are being produced by the SPS.
