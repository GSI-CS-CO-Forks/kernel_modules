TimLib is a highlevel API that makes full use of other libraries such as Tgm and Tgv.
In principal this library will be depricated (I have my doubts). In any case we must still maintaine it for years to come.

The test sud-directory contains tools that help users of timlib debug their code.

WARNING: !!!!

There is a sub-directory in test TcpStuff that contaians vital operational programs such as TimServer TimClient SendCNGS RecvCNGS
See the readme in test.
