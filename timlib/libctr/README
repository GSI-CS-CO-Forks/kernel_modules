README Mon 14th May 2012, Julian Lewis BE/CO/HT

This is the libctr timing library. It contains no knowledge of higher level timing structures.
The former timing library timlib will be replaced by a high level API implemented in the timing section.
This library is completely specific to the CTR timing modules and provides an agreed API for this
next high level library, it hence makes no attempt to hide CTR specifics.
The libctr comes in 3 parts, libctr.a, libctrp.so and libctrv.so and provides specific code for the
ctrp and ctrv modules in tailored shared objects. The libctra determins the module type and loads the
corresponding shared object.
These shared objects are kept in the same place as the ctr driver kernel objects.

The make file does all the work needed to build and install the library, shared objects and includes.

There is a test program that tests all libctr functions in the sub directory "test". In this directory
the Makefile builds and installs the test programs. This program can be launched on any Linux dsc via
the command libctrtest. The code in LibCtrCmds.c serves as a complete coding example for all calls.

There is a subdirectory "doc" that builds and installs the libctr documentation as generated by
doxygen in html, man, and latex formats.

For the present the root directory is /acc/src/dsc/drivers/cohtdrep/lewis/timlib which is where it
got developed, later it will be moved

Cheers Julian
