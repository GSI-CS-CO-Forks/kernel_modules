This version of the SL Tg8 firmware can read SPS telegrams and UTC time events
It has been extesivley modified and is only suitable for dynamic loading,
it can not be epromed as it modifies itself at initialization time.

To compile it run make in ../CrossFirmware for cross compilation

Fri 10th June Julian Lewis: Modifications as follows...
 --  Removed statically initialized memory so that program can be
       downloaded accross the VME bus.
 --  Added static memory initialization to the SoftInit routine for
       download capability.
 --  Implemented SPS telegram support.
 --  Removed all logic to do with the old date/time formats for the
       legacy events for tg3, and PS tg8.
 --  Implemented full UTC time support based on the Tgv events.
 --  The handling of the SUPER-CYCLE number in the old 0x20 header
       now returns the 32 bit UTC time instead of the 24 bit payload.
 --  Some general tidy up of the code, in particular so that the O3
       optimization can be turned on hardware addresses are declared
       as volatile. This makes the code much faster.
 --  Watchdog code has been changed to avoid O3 problem, it is now
       written in assembler to get over O3 optimization problems.
 -- Modified logic around SPS 21 and 24 event headers so tyhat the firmware
       handles telegrams correctly and allows connecting to interrupts
       for both headers.

Fri 29th July:
 -- Bug in the way in_use array is used for 24 headers corrected in isr.c
       by not looking at in_use when handling ready-pls events.
 -- Bug in 24 group restriction corrected.
       telegrams with more than 24 groups were writing all over memory !!
 -- Bug in the way headers are checked in isr corrected
 -- I put the 16-Bit SCcount-Logic in place, this mod needs a driver mod to
       unscramble little-endien byte order.
 -- Lots and lots of tidying up done
       I could suppress at least 50% of the code, but the effort ins't worth
       the gain. It works, but beware the SL-Tg8 firmware is one of the worst
       examples of BF I have ever seen. Only experts who know what they are
       doing should think about touching this code.
