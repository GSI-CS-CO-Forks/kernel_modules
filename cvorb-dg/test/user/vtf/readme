Waveform file format (.vtf)
===========================

The waveform is given to the test program as an array of points.
Inside the driver, this array is transfomed in vectors for the hardware.

The points format is:

time[ms]  | amplitude[digital value]

* Digital values for amplitude must be between 0 and 65535 (2^16).
* Internal stop can be added to a waveform. Put 0 in the time column to insert an internal stop.
