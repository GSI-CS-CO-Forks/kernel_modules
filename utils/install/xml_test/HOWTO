xmlconfig can be called either with FEC name or driver name.
Program output is going to stdout. Redirect it if needed.

Examples:

1. xmlconfig cfv-865-mkdev1 > cfv-865-mkdev1.xml
2. xmlconfig CIBM > CIBM.xml

In second case -- host field in <install> tag will be set to "any"
You can check if .xml is correct using 'test' programs in this dir.
