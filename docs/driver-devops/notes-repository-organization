The historical tendency since 2010 has been to host all low-level code
(drivers, libraries and ancillary support files) in a single non-bare
git repository at

/acc/src/dsc/drivers/coht/

(hereafter, $COHT).

This tendency has progressively been broken due to the following factors

* inability of developers to stick to a single-repository workflow,
  mainly for fear of git
* outsourced developments typically hosted externally (ohwr.org) as
  per-project git repos
* projects started as out-of-tree, non-merged code that never integrated
  properly or were injected into $COHT as submodules

The resulting situation at this date (Aug 2015) is that $COHT contains
most of the codebase maintained by the drivers team, but with some of
the projects included as submodules, or as mere subdiretories.

This situation is undesirable and we should aim at two final scenarios

* single-tree repository holding all the code base
* umbrella repository containing all the projects as submodules and
  describing their dependencies

The first option has been rendered almost impossible by the practice of
hosting most FMC developments as separate, OHWR-hosted projects with
their own presumedly independent git repository.

The word "presumedly" is a fiction: most FMC developments, however
independently managed as different OHWR projects, are heavily
interdependent. This has resulted in a maze of submodules devised to
alleviate this dependency hell, with relative success, we should say.

None of these problems happens in the context of the classical
development model, where barely *any* dependency occurs despite the fact
that all different drivers are hosted in the same tree. The only hard
dependency these modules have in common is on the vmebus driver.
