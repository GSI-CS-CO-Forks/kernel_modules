* Sacrificial machine: cfv-774-cdv32

* To change boot server / boot image: go to cs-ccr-feop and
  in /acc/sys/adm/ get credentials through ./get_hw -sh and change boot
  server image through ./boot_select

* Development for SLC7 is cs-ccr-el7 (possibly missing bits)
  Development for SLC[56] is cs-ccr-dev[1-4] (any one of these
      cross-compiles to the indicated architecture)

* master git repository under the usual /acc/src/dsc/drivers/coht;
  some of the drivers are under submodules

* list of drivers in order of priority (approx).

* must be compatible with the three kernels in production, conditional
  compilation on kernel version being the last resort

* usually, what we do, what should work:

	make CPU=L867

  or, worst case
  	make CPU=L867 KVER=a.b.c.d.e.f.g-el7.d.f.

  in the kernel, we JUST want to say
  	make LINUX=/lib/..../2.6.27
  for module compilation to work.
