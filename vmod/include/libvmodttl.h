 *  \mainpage VMOD-TTL Device Driver
 *  \author Samuel Iglesias Gonsalvez BE/CO/HT
 *  \version 21 September 2010
 *
 * The VMOD-TTL hardware module is an opto-isolated digital input/output
 * with 20 bit TTL-level. There are three channels: two of 8 bits and one of 4 bits.
 * This driver exposes a minimum functionality of the boards capabilities.
 * More functions can be added later if needed.
 *
 * In this version of the driver the following capabilities are provided.
 *
 * 1) Open/Close the device.
 * 
 * 2) Setup the channels: direction, logic, time of the data strobe, and the working mode: open 
 * drain/collector for output channels**. 
 * <b>NOTICE: It must be done before any read/write operation.</b>
 * 
 * 3) Read/Write in each channel.
 *
 * 4) Data strobe in channel C:
 *
 * <table align="center" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="1">
 * <tr>
 *   <td colspan="4" align="center"><strong>Data Strobe (Channel C)</strong></td>
 * </tr>

 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">Channel</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Operation</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Value</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">A</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Read</td>
 * 	<td align="center">0x4</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">B</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Read</td>
 * 	<td align="center">0x8</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">A</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Write</td>
 * 	<td align="center">0x1</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">B</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Write</td>
 * 	<td align="center">0x2</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * 	<td align="center">A and B</td>
 * 	<td align="center">Write</td>
 * 	<td align="center">0x3</td>
 * </tr> </table>
 *
 * * Only for channel A and B, because channel C is configured as output for data strobe purpose.
 *
 * ** An input channel is configured as normal mode.
