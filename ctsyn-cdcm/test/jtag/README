We can change the VHDL program in the xilinx FPGA remotely from the test
program. See the jtag command. This code was downloaded from the xilinx
web site, and it understands the xilinx xsvf binary file format, and it
implements the jtag state machine engine.

I provide the backend in ports.c, I was obliged to change some of this code
to make it work, I would stay away from this stuff unless you know what you
are doing.

ports.c     :   Implementation of jtag backend based on the bstdriver ioctl
ports.h     :   Types use in ports.c

So called system/platform independent stuff, which needed none the less to
be modified, so it is not the orriginal. BEWARE.

lenval.c    :   Changed by me !!!
lenval.h    :
micro.c     :   Changed by me !!!
micro.h     :
RCS         :   Directory: Versions of this code


N.B. The code I down loaded was of very poor quaility, and targeted a windows
system using PC centric C compiler using bit fields that worked in an other
way with gcc. Hence it took me some time to get it to work, change it at your
own risk.
