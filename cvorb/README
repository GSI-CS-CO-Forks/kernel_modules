new cvorb driver by Michel Arruat

* lib functions prototypes:
	There is some inconsistencies in the meaning of what a function returns : value or error?
	One possible convention:
		- values: passed to the user by means of output arguments
		- error: passed to the user using the return value: 0:no error, -1: error, enum for erroCode?).
		Therefore the return type should be uint16_t
		In case of a function not returning errors the return type should be void.

* headers file name convention:
	Any CERN driver is made of 2 major software component: the driver itself and on top of it a library.
	acting as a public API for user. Each components defines a set of headers and we could decide to 
	homogenize the naming schema. Again the motivation is to make the user life easier.
	For example, for a driver called xyz we could have: 
		- xyz.h: library public header defining the API. Should be the only one includes by the user.
		- xyz_private.h: library private header if necessary
		- xyz_driver.h: driver public header
		- xyz_driver_private.h: driver private header file.
		- xyz_driver_defs: driver public header containing definition (enum, constants)
		  shared between library and driver. Normally should be include by "xyz.h".

* header includes
	why local drivers are not included via their package name which is a common practice.
	For instance instead of doing:
	#include <vmebus.h>
	we should write
	#include <vmedriver/vmebus.h>
	
* git:
	- tag: one possible usage of a tag is to assign the version number to a commit:
		git tag v1.0.2.
